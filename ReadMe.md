# Vehicle OOP :Wink:

In this project I have created 3 classes. The first class created
is the vehicle class. In which the characteristics for the cargo size and passenger
capacity are defined. In addition the methods declared are acceleration and breaking. 

Secondly using inheritance I have created the plane class and the car class, adding characteristics such as 
horsepower , max speed and brand. In addition methods such as takeoff and touchdown are created for plane and 
park and honk are created for the car class. 

I have tested the Classes by calling them in the run_vehicle file, printing 
the output to see if the desired output is achieved. 

### Classes
```
plane_class.py
vehicle_class.py 
car_class.py

```

### Vehicle_Class
```
Characterristics:
Number of Passengers
Cargo Size

#Methods :
# accelerate
# breaking
```

### Car_Class
```
Used Inheritance 

Added Characterisics:
brand
horsepower
max_speed

Added Methods:
park 
honk 
```

### Plane Class
```
Used Inheritance 

Added Characterisics:
brand
horsepower
max_speed

Added Methods:
touchdown
take_off
```

### run_vehicle
```Python
#Pseudo-Code

# import all the classes
# create 2 vehicle instances
# call methods and attributes to test
# create 2 car instances
# make car accelerate and make them break
# make car honk and park# create 2 plane instances 
# make plane accelerate and make them break
# make plane fly and land

```
