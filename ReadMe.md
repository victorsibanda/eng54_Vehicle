#Vehicle OOP

In this project I have created 3 classes. The first class created
is the vehicle class. In which the characteristics for the cargo size and passenger
capacity are defined. In addition the methods declared are acceleration and breaking. 

Secondly using inheritance I have created the plane class and the car class, adding characteristics such as 
horsepower , max speed and brand. In addition methods such as takeoff and touchdown are created for plane and 
park and honk are created for the car class. 

I have tested the Classes by calling them in the run_vehicle file, printing 
the output to see if the desired output is achieved.
